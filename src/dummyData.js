    description: 'Lough Erne is one of Northern Ireland’s newer venues and offers stunning views as well as a top-class course that I know from experience is always in great shape. The closing stretch of 16-17-18 is especially good, the beautiful lough in play on all three holes. In any kind of wind they are enough to test even the best players. I know I have always been forced to hit some of my better shots just to make pars. The hotel, too, is lovely. For any length of golfing break it is just about the perfect place to stay.',
